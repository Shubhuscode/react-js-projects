  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>
    This HTML document showcases a simple implementation of object-oriented programming in JavaScript through the creation of a class named <code>Car</code>. The <code>Car</code> class features a constructor that sets the car's brand and a method to return a message displaying the car's brand. Additionally, a subclass named <code>Model</code> extends the <code>Car</code> class, adding a model attribute and a method to present both the brand and model of the car. Upon loading the page, an instance of the <code>Model</code> class is created with the brand "Ford" and model "Mustang", and the message "I have a Ford, it is a Mustang" is displayed on the webpage. This example effectively illustrates fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming in JavaScript within an HTML environment.
