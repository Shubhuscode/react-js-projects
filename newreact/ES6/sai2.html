  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>
    This HTML document demonstrates the creation of a simple JavaScript class named Car. The class includes a constructor that initializes the car's brand and a method to present the car's brand. When the page is loaded, it instantiates a Car object with the brand "Ford" and displays the message "I have a Ford" on the webpage. This example illustrates basic object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript within an HTML context.

  <h2>Output:</h2>
  
<script>
class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }

  present() {
    return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
  }
}

const mycar = new Car("Ford");
document.write(mycar.present());
</script>
